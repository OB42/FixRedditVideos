A small extension/userscript to fix the buggy Reddit video player that never loads(you can't change the volume or resolution for now(720P), maybe I'll add it later)

You can install the userscript here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OB42/FixRedditVideos/main/FixRedditVideos.user.js

For that you'll either need Greasemonkey installed on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/

Or TamperMonkey on Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

Or you can enable Developer Mode on Chrome and install the extension by downloading it here: https://github.com/OB42/FixRedditVideos/blob/main/FixRedditVideos.crx?raw=true

(Chrome now asks for money to be able to upload extensions publicly on the webstore... I'm not paying those thieves to upload free stuff lol)


After that just go to reddit.com and videos should actually load for once :)
